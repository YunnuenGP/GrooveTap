# TO-DO List  
  1.- Move paperscript to an external file.

# Wish List
  1.- Add support for recording keys pressed and their times, so we can reproduce the combination.  
  2.- Add support for changing sounds available. (Like keyword options).  
  3.- Add support for reproduce a combination of keys on background while playing with keys, so we can make a song.
